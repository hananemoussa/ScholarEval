{"statement": "The sandwich-format MaMBA technique, which employs nanobodies that recognize primary IgG antibodies, may have limited scalability compared to existing methods that directly couple oligonucleotides to primary antibodies because the C-region types of primary antibodies are relatively restricted, meaning that the nanobody-based detection may constrain the number of target proteins that can be analyzed simultaneously.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "In the context of MaMBA-assisted HCR-based protein detection (misHCR), the number of proteins that can be analyzed simultaneously is inherently constrained by fluorescence wavelength overlap in microscopy, which limits its multiplexing capability compared to direct coupling approaches.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "Direct coupling of oligonucleotides to primary antibodies can facilitate the simultaneous measurement of a significantly greater number of protein targets than the sandwich-based nanobody MaMBA approach in the barcode-ELISA/NGS-based BLISA technique.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The authors present an innovative approach in this research plan that circumvents these limitations by employing nanobody-based antibody mimetics, which recognize antibodies, instead of directly coupling oligonucleotides to conventional antibodies. This strategy facilitates oligonucleotide conjugation - designed to target the initiator hairpin oligonucleotide of HCR -through peptide ligation and click chemistry.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The study employs optogenetic stimulation simultaneously with fiber photometry recording of dopamine or serotonin release measured with genetically encoded sensors, which are state-of-the-art methods offering tighter temporal control compared to pharmacological methods for manipulating dopamine and serotonin and improved selectivity over techniques like electrochemistry and microdialysis used to record neuromodulator release in previous studies on the subject.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The findings would be strengthened by the addition of a fluorophore-only control group lacking opsin expression in all experiments involving VTA DA neuron stimulation and DRN SERT neuron stimulation.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "One way to strengthen the study could be to stimulate serotonin axons in the striatum (as opposed to the serotonin cell bodies in the DRN) and record striatal dopamine release.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "A complementary anatomical approach would be to use retrograde tracing to test whether the DR 5HT neurons projecting to the striatum are the same or different from the VTA projecting population.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The experiment of stimulating serotonin neurons and recording serotonin release in the NAc was not performed, and it would be useful to be able to compare the magnitudes of evoked serotonin release in these two striatal regions, though it is not central to the main claims of the research plan.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "This is a topic well worth studying.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

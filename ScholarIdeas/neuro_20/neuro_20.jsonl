{"statement": "In examining some of the model fits, it looks like the 'taste weight' parameter is being constrained below 1, which might be unfairly penalizing these models since theoretically the taste weight could go above 1 if participants had a negative weight on health.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The mediation model is questionable because it's unclear why hunger should change the dwell time on the chosen item rather than focusing on the dwell time on the tasty option.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "While the within-participant design is appreciated, it raises concerns about potential demand effects, and the results would be more compelling if they replicated when only analyzing the first session from each participant.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The labeling of food choices as being taste- or health-driven is misleading since participants were not cued to select health vs taste, and the label 'healthy' is misleading as it seems strongly related to caloric density rather than intrinsic healthiness.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The experimental design comparing the protein shake condition to the natural fasted state cannot rule between alternative interpretations of observed effects, as effects could be due to the drink's active ingredients, consuming a drink versus nothing, or both.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The key weakness of the paper is that there already exists a benchmark for testing the linguistic reasoning skills of LLMs, specifically LINGOLY (Bean et al., 2024), also comprised of puzzles from the Linguistic Olympiad, and it seems that LINGOLY has a wider scope than Linguini, so it is not clear what Linguini adds beyond LINGOLY.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The motivation for putting the constraint that models must learn and utilize the characteristics of previously unseen languages solely through in-context learning is unclear, and the broader impact of this study on future LLM research is somewhat unclear due to the huge difference of these assumptions.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "It would be good to fully understand why creating a benchmark to evaluate linguistic skills of the model (unrelated to language specific learning) is an important problem, and whether a toy dataset that tests linguistic abilities but isn't a real language could be built instead.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "As the authors have discussed, the sampled set of problems from the International Linguistic Olympiad is possibly biased towards phonographic languages, where the logographic languages, for which transliteration does lose some information, are not well represented.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "While IOL problems can indeed be called requiring 'linguistic reasoning' skills, these skills are essentially a form, or a combination of inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning skills, and it would be interesting to ground each of the problems to the required skills and perform a more in-depth analysis.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "It is unclear whether the benchmark is realistic and how it affects real-world applications.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}

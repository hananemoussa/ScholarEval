{"statement": "In the re-analysis of the compiled meta-analytic data to assess generalizability using hierarchical models, the research plan proposes using only the intercept as a fixed effect, but in practice, many meta-analyses include moderators in their models, and ignoring these moderators could result in attributing heterogeneity to unexplained variation at the study or paper level, leading to inaccurately wide or narrow prediction intervals and erroneous assessment of generalizability.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan proposes using a t-distribution to generate the prediction intervals and distributions for the hierarchical meta-analysis model, but the t-distribution is not strictly appropriate for models with random effects because the variances of random effects must be estimated from the data, and using a t-distribution does not account for the uncertainty in estimating these variance components, making the approach typically anti-conservative unless the data is perfectly balanced.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan defines generalizability as the likelihood that a future study will yield a significantly non-zero effect, but this definition may not address the primary concern for many meta-analyses or individual studies, which often aim to understand the mean response or effect within a specific context rather than focusing on whether a future study will produce a significant result.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}

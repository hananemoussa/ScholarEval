{"statement": "The dynamic perturbation strategy aims to prevent memorization but may inadvertently introduce ambiguity into test cases, creating inconsistencies in evaluating LLM performance, especially if slight changes in prompt phrasing lead to variations in model responses.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The reliance on superficial perturbations (surface-level changes) may not effectively challenge models in understanding complex circuit design concepts.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The GenBen benchmark does not appear to account for complex timing closure tasks, such as handling Total Negative Slack (TNS) and Worst Negative Slack (WNS) for high-frequency designs, potentially falling short in evaluating LLMs' ability to generate designs that meet stringent timing requirements critical for high-performance applications.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Although the benchmark includes debugging tests, it may not fully capture the complexity of real-world hardware debugging, particularly for stateful designs or asynchronous circuits, with the current debugging scope seeming limited to relatively straightforward syntax and functional errors without addressing state-based errors, race conditions, or setup/hold timing violations.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "While the inclusion of multimodal tests is innovative, the integration of textual and visual data (e.g., diagrams) lacks specific detail on how visual data is processed or scored, which may lead to ambiguous scoring for models that perform differently across multimodal and text-based tasks.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The QoR metrics focus on synthesizability, power, area, and timing but do not assess finer aspects like pipeline balancing, parallelism optimizations, or state-machine efficiency, which are crucial for high-performance designs and should be part of a rigorous hardware benchmark.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "It is unclear how the perturbation process ensures the creation of sound problems, avoiding ambiguity or unclear meanings.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The test categories show data imbalance with disparities across task categories (e.g., 99 Design tasks vs. 57 Debug tasks), and while task diversity is commendable, the authors should clarify why such an imbalance exists and discuss potential implications for model performance assessment.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The model selection introduces nine models across five families but lacks justification for these particular choices, and clarifying why specific models (e.g., GPT, Claude, LLaMA, QWEN, and GLM families) were included could strengthen the argument.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research plan divides tasks into three difficulty levels (L1 to L3) with proper descriptions, but detailing how each tier's tasks correspond to LAD challenges (e.g., debugging complexity or resource optimization) would add valuable context.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The pass@5 scoring strategy is introduced without much context on its relevance to LAD tasks, and explaining why pass@5 is chosen over other scoring metrics and how it aligns with real-world LAD evaluation would strengthen its justification.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

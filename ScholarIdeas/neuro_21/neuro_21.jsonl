{"statement": "The sequential motor skill learning task is well established and neatly designed to allow for tracking learning and how individual sequence elements contribute.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The inclusion of short offline rest periods between learning epochs in the experimental design is valuable because it allows investigation of micro-offline rest periods where most behavioral gains occur.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The proposed range of new decoding techniques exhaustively interrogates the data in different ways, using different decoding approaches.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "A concern is that within individual frequency bands, the highest decoding accuracy seems to be within frequencies that match the rate of keypresses, which is a general concern when relating movement to brain activity.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan does not specify restraint to the arm or shoulder, and it is conceivable that small head movements would correlate highly with the vigor of individual finger movements, potentially confounding the MEG signals.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "When combining voxel and parcel space in the hybrid-space approach, there is a concern about potential circularity contributing to improved accuracy because it uses the same MEG signals twice - the voxels most contributing are also those contributing most to a parcel being identified as relevant.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The use of temporally rich neural information (MEG signal) has a large advantage over previous studies testing sequential representations using fMRI, allowing examination of the earliest period of skill learning with finer temporal resolution.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The pursuit of high decoding accuracy, especially the choice of time points and window length (200 msec window starting from 0 msec from key press onset), casts a shadow on the interpretation of the main result as it is unclear whether the decoding results simply reflect behavioral change or true underlying neural change.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Testing only one particular sequence (4-1-3-2-4), aside from the control ones, limits the generalizability of the finding.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "In terms of clinical BCI applications, it is not clear that the specific time window chosen (up to 200 msec since key press onset) is really useful since clinical BCI would target neural signals with no overt movement execution due to patients' inability to move.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The innovative hybrid-space decoding approach is a clear strength, achieving impressive decoding accuracies via dimension reduction that follows the neurobiologically plausible idea of concurrent distribution of neural coding across local circuits as well as large-scale networks.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

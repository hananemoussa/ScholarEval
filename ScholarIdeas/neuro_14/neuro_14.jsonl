{"statement": "The definition of 'hyperaltruistic' is unclear - it seems to mean 'willing to pay more to reduce other's pain than their own pain', but participants never actually PAY something to reduce the other's pain in the proposed task, and it's unclear what makes it 'HYPER-altruistic' rather than simply 'altruistic'.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan mentions that 'boundary conditions' remain unexplored in the introduction, but this idea is never developed further - what boundary conditions mean in this task context is unclear.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The motivation for examining decision context is not well justified - it comes somewhat out of the blue that the research plan states investigating decision context without explaining why this factor is more important than studying other potential factors.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan includes two types of models (harm aversion model and logistic regression models) that look similar, and it's unclear if there is a way to combine them rather than using both separately.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research question examining the boundary conditions of hyperaltruistic tendency in moral decision-making and its neural basis is theoretically important.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The research plan does not provide evidence to support why any of the behavior being measured is extreme enough to warrant the modifier 'hyper' in hyperaltruism.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The task does not constitute altruism, but rather the decision to engage, or not engage, in instrumental aggression - deciding to hurt someone for personal benefit (whether acquiring financial gain or avoiding loss) is the definition of instrumental aggression, not altruism.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "In the proposed studies, there is no possibility of acting to benefit the other participant in any condition - true altruism would be to accept shocks to the self for the other's benefit, but altruism is not equivalent to refraining from engaging in instrumental aggression.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The interpretation of this task as assessing instrumental aggression is supported by the focus on the Instrumental Harm subscale of the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale rather than the Impartial Benevolence subscale.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research plan should better incorporate evidence from non-human animals on origins of oxytocin as a hormone selected for its role in maternal care and defense, as the non-human animal literature regarding oxytocin effects is more robust and definitive than the human literature.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "It will be important to explain why oxytocin would be relevant to refraining from instrumental aggression by drawing on the non-human animal literature showing that oxytocin motivates defensive care.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

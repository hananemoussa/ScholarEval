{"statement": "The idea leaves unclear how auto-phosphorylation shapes the monomer/dimer equilibrium, even though this mechanism is central to the conceptual framing. Without explicitly addressing this, the idea risks obscuring one of its key claims.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The idea references monomeric cytosolic states and kinase-active oligomers, but it remains vague about whether dimers or oligomers arise only at the membrane. Greater precision here would strengthen the idea by clarifying whether the mechanism depends on lipid or membrane-associated protein interactions.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research plan should clarify what is meant by oligomers and whether there are more than dimers found localized to the membrane, as the mass photometry experiments are designed to monitor monomer-dimer equilibrium but the broader context discusses oligomeric forms.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

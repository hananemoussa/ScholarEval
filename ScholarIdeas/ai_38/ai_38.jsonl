{"statement": "Assumptions like ignorability may limit the applications, as an empirical observation from many social/health sciences is that sensitive attributes are often causally entangled with many/most other relevant variables, so as long as there are any unobserved variables those variables are likely to be confounders.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The independence from the true label in Assumption 1 is strong - why should the true label be independent of the sensitive attribute?", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The extension applies primarily to certain narrowly defined scenarios, which may limit its broader applicability and introduce additional challenges in estimation, particularly when defining principal strata for diverse datasets.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "A notable limitation is the partial identification of principal counterfactual fairness - since the fairness criterion is only partially identifiable, it is impossible to obtain fully unbiased point estimates, which raises concerns about the potential implications of estimation bias.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "It is challenging to compare the proposed PCF with the original CF - is it possible to define principle CF within the SCM framework and what would the causal relationships between A, Y, and D look like in a causal graph?", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The choice of dataset lacks justification - why not use datasets like Law or UCI Adult, which are more commonly used in CF literature?", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The motivation behind using a causal discovery algorithm and creating subgroups based on its results is unclear, particularly since the definition of PCF is not based on an SCM.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan only provides a necessary condition for an algorithm to satisfy PCF, which relies on the minimum and maximum values of the solution to an optimization problem, but the effectiveness of this criterion is uncertain - what is the likelihood that an algorithm could pass this test without truly satisfying PCF?", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The problem formulation is flawed by design - the authors only consider principal strata for sensitive attributes that causally don't affect the actual outcome, but why would we ever care about enforcing fairness when that is not the case?", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "It is possible that the differences in cleavage efficiencies between peptides are due to unexpected conformational changes in the peptide upon labelling with MCA and Dnp, requiring enzymatic assays in the absence of labels and MD simulations with the bona fide peptides including the labels used in the kinetic measurements.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan uses A531S variant in TRMT1-derived peptide to disrupt the P3\u00b4-in conformation, and while the rationale behind A531S design is sound, it is important to confirm experimentally that the mutation disrupted the P3\u00b4-in conformation in favor of the P3\u00b4-out conformer.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The molecular dynamics simulations proposed in the research plan could be used to determine if the TRMT1 A531S variant favors the P3\u00b4-out conformation.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "An unanswered question not addressed in the research plan is whether the peptides undergo conformational changes upon Mpro binding or if they are pre-organized to adopt the P3\u00b4-out and P3\u00b4-in conformations.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}

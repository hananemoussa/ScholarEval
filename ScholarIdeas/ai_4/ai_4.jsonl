{"statement": "The authors introduce important ideas for better evaluating fine-tuned models: (a) evaluating models on completely held out proteins and (b) developing a metric that prioritizes performance on LoF and GoF variants over neutral variants.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Insufficient comparison to existing fine-tuning approaches: PreMode and augmented unsupervised models are not the only approaches that have been proposed to fine-tune protein language models on DMS datasets, as these papers explore strategies such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning and fine-tuning jointly on multiple DMS assays that this paper does not consider.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "While the idea to compute separate correlation metrics for LoF, neutral, and GoF variants is clever, the method of dividing variants into these categories by splitting the ground-truth scores into thirds is arbitrary, and a more robust method such as a Gaussian mixture model with three components could provide a more principled assignment.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The methodology of ESMGain can predict functional effects without the limitation of feature redundancy and task specificity by employing two independent ESM2 models to embed wildtype and mutant sequences separately, addressing potential information loss in mutation representation.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The plan proposes a novel benchmarking framework for functional effect prediction that incorporates a cross-protein generalization test within the same protein family.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The motivation of the proposed benchmarking framework is underdeveloped, as while focusing on cross-protein generalization within the same family is technically interesting, it lacks a clear connection to real-world situations where this type of evaluation would be essential.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The key contribution of having separate ESM2 heads for wildtype and mutated sequences is questionable, as there is no fundamental reason to distinguish between the sequences and using this distinction based on dataset definition may only lead to overfitting to the dataset.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The Harmonic Spearman metric is introduced without sufficient motivation, and authors should explain the choice of using harmonic average and provide evidence for bringing a new useful inductive bias by taking the two separately fine-tuned ESM2 heads.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

{"statement": "There is no replication built into the experimental design, which is problematic since egg lay is a highly variable trait even within treatments and it is standard practice to replicate mosquito fitness experiments.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The sample size is particularly small for some groups (e.g. 15 egg rafts for the second gonotrophic cycle of mice in the autumn), which limits the statistical power to detect treatment effects.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Cx. quinquefasciatus host switching has not been observed in Argentina, only in the northern hemisphere, so it is possible that the species could have an entirely different ecology in Argentina.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The comparison between the discrete eviction method and chunk-based method in the research plan may be true from a human behavior perspective, as some useful information may have been corrupted. However, in LLMs, the information of the corrupted tokens may still be retained in some other preserved tokens due to the attention mechanism, and the internal information of different tokens in LLMs is difficult to explain, making the explanation of the motivation seem somewhat arbitrary.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan lacks detailed attention score or L1 loss analysis between full cache and compressed cache of the proposed ChunkKV method compared to existing discrete methods, which should be explored to validate the approach.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The approach has limited novelty as leveraging cross-layer similarity has been studied in MiniCache, and the research plan would benefit from a discussion and comparison with MiniCache.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The chunking-based selection proposed in ChunkKV is very related to clustering-based selection, as the pool1D technique used in SnapKV, requiring better differentiation and comparison.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The ChunkKV methodology introduces a significant inductive bias through its dependency on chunk size, making the model's performance highly sensitive to chunk size which varies across tasks, limiting its general applicability in open-ended evaluations where optimal chunk size determination becomes unfeasible.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "While the research plan highlights fragmentation in KV cache compression as a motivation, SnapKV has already proposed clustering methods to improve accuracy, which should be acknowledged and compared against.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}

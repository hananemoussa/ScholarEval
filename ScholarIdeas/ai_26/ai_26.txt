# Research Plan: ChunkKV - Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference

## Problem

We identify a critical limitation in existing KV cache compression methods for Large Language Models (LLMs). While current approaches like H2O and SnapKV effectively reduce GPU memory usage by compressing the key-value cache to less than 50% of its original size, they operate on discrete tokens, which leads to significant loss of semantic information. This discrete token-based compression can result in the retention of relevant keywords while omitting crucial contextual information such as subjects, objects, and their relationships.

For example, when processing a passage about animal diets, discrete methods might retain the word "strawberries" while discarding information about which animals consume them, leading to potential misinterpretation. This problem is particularly pronounced in multi-document question-answering tasks where maintaining semantic coherence across multiple sources is essential for accurate comprehension and response generation.

Our hypothesis is that preserving semantic chunks rather than individual tokens will better maintain the contextual relationships necessary for accurate long-context processing while achieving comparable or superior compression ratios.

## Method

We propose ChunkKV, a novel KV cache compression method that preserves semantic information by retaining coherent chunks of tokens rather than individual discrete tokens. Our approach consists of two main components:

**ChunkKV Algorithm**: We will group consecutive tokens into semantic chunks of size c, where each chunk represents a coherent unit of meaning (e.g., subject-verb-object relationships). For compression, we will:
1. Calculate observation scores for chunks by summing attention scores across tokens within each chunk
2. Select the top-k chunks based on these aggregated scores using the same selection policy as existing methods
3. Preserve the sequential order of selected chunks to maintain narrative flow
4. Concatenate an observation window to retain recent important information

**Layer-wise Index Reuse**: Based on our preliminary analysis showing that ChunkKV produces more similar preserved indices across adjacent layers compared to discrete methods, we will implement a technique to reuse chunk indices across multiple layers. This approach will reduce computational overhead by computing chunk selection only for every Nth layer and reusing those indices for intermediate layers.

We will implement ChunkKV as a drop-in replacement for existing KV cache compression methods, maintaining compatibility with current transformer architectures while providing semantic-aware compression.

## Experiment Design

We will conduct comprehensive experiments across three main evaluation categories:

**Long-Context Benchmarks**: We will evaluate ChunkKV on LongBench and Needle-In-A-HayStack (NIAH) benchmarks using LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct models. We will test compression ratios of 10%, 20%, and 30% to assess performance across different memory constraints. For LongBench, we will evaluate across 17 datasets covering single-document QA, multi-document QA, summarization, few-shot learning, and synthetic tasks. For NIAH, we will test retrieval capabilities across context lengths of 8k and 32k tokens.

**In-Context Learning Evaluation**: We will assess ChunkKV's effectiveness on GSM8K arithmetic reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought prompting at a 30% compression ratio. This will test whether semantic preservation improves the model's ability to maintain reasoning chains across long contexts.

**Ablation Studies**: We will conduct systematic ablation studies to determine optimal chunk sizes ranging from 1 to 30 tokens, evaluate the effectiveness of layer-wise index reuse across different numbers of reuse layers, and analyze the trade-offs between compression efficiency and performance degradation.

**Comparative Analysis**: We will compare ChunkKV against existing methods (StreamingLLM, H2O, SnapKV, PyramidKV) using identical experimental settings. We will measure both task performance and computational efficiency, including compression time and memory usage.

**Similarity Analysis**: We will quantify the semantic preservation capabilities of ChunkKV by measuring layer-wise similarity of preserved indices using Jaccard similarity coefficients and analyzing attention pattern preservation compared to discrete token methods.

All experiments will be conducted three times with mean scores reported to ensure statistical robustness. We will evaluate performance across multiple languages using Qwen2-7B-Instruct on Chinese subtasks to assess cross-lingual effectiveness.

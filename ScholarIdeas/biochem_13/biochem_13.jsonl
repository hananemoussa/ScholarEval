{"statement": "There is a conceptual confusion between thermal stability and solubility in the PISA approach, as thermal stability is a thermodynamic parameter described by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation relating free energy differences between folded and unfolded states, while PISA actually measures changes in protein solubility which is an empirical parameter affected by many variables including ambient proteins and other molecules.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The use of a single high concentration of 10\u03bcM for all compounds in the chemical library is problematic, as many compounds likely have low nM IC50s, making this concentration multiple orders of magnitude above their target inhibition levels, which makes it difficult to assess the relevance of identified off-target effects to clinical applications or biological experiments.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The learning component of the proposed algorithm and the regret analysis approach are fairly standard, as there exists an optimal matching between plays and arms, and the remaining task is to target this optimal matching through UCB strategy, as done in much of the literature.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

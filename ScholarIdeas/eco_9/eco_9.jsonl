{"statement": "The two experimental setups differed significantly in photoperiod and light conditions (13-hour photoperiod at 4,300 lux versus 16-hour ambient day length at 6,900 lux), but the criteria for selecting these conditions and their representation of real-world scenarios are not adequately justified.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "While the research plan investigates temperature effects around the summer solstice on primary growth cessation, it fails to distinguish the influence of photoperiod from temperature effects, despite the summer solstice marking an important photoperiod transition.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The use of potted trees in controlled environments limits the generalization of results to natural forests, as wild trees are subject to additional variables such as competition and precipitation that are not accounted for in the experimental design.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The proposed temperature treatments (such as 2\u00b0C at night and 7\u00b0C during the day through May, then 7/13\u00b0C in July) are extreme and not representative of natural conditions in European systems.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "In Experiment 1, the control is confounded with the growth chamber experience, as control plants never experience chamber conditions while all treatments include significant time in chambers.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Despite the authors' extrapolations to carbon dynamics and forest responses, the research plan lacks metrics related to carbon assimilation and only includes limited photosynthetic measurements in Experiment 2.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "Using only Fagus sylvatica, which has outlier responses to photoperiod and other cues and leafs out very late, to generalize results across temperate tree species is questionable given the species' unique characteristics.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan oversimplifies end-of-season (EOS) complexity by focusing primarily on bud set while ignoring that different plant parts shut down at different times, and different EOS metrics (budset, end of radial expansion, leaf coloring) relate to different physiological processes.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan lacks adequate connection to the physiology of end-of-season processes and fails to provide sufficient explanation for focusing specifically on budset as the primary phenological marker.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

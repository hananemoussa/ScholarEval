{"statement": "The research plan appears to oversimplify the concept of causality and its role in prediction tasks, potentially conflating correlation with causation in some instances, such as the sporting event example which doesn't demonstrate direct cause-and-effect relationships but rather correlation due to viewer behavior.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The use of terms like 'dissimilar information' in the methodology is vague and doesn't clearly explain what causal information might be captured that similarity-based approaches miss.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research plan seems to imply that causal approaches are superior to similarity-based approaches in all cases, without providing sufficient evidence for this claim.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The way SPACE infers the causal structures through pseudo transfer entropy is not fully convincing, as it assumes that 'the time series follow the normal distribution' which is an extremely strong assumption and not acceptable for real-world time series.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "Without clear experimental support for its causal relationship advantages, SPACE may appear as a combination of existing techniques (pTE, attention, GCN, and mixers) without sufficient innovation in causality extraction.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Since one of the main contributions is about causal GNN, some GNN related works should be mentioned and compared in the experimental design.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The method introduces the fast-pTE algorithm and emphasizes its efficiency advantage in contributions, but lacks detailed theoretical analysis, ablation studies about variants with TE, pTE, and fast-pTE, and efficiency comparisons with state-of-the-art works.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

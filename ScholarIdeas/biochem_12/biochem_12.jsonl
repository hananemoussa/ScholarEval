{"statement": "The study explores an interesting aspect of cell wall hydrolases in terms of substrate-level regulation and potentially identified new enzymatic activity of LytM.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The experimental strategy using solution-state NMR spectroscopy and its implementation are robust and would provide for a thorough analysis of LSS and LytM enzymatic activities.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The plan uses only the catalytic domain of both proteins, with no mention of other domains and no justification of why only the catalytic domain will be studied, despite the fact that substrate specificity of these enzymes is regulated by their substrate-binding domains.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The authors compare a series of formal approaches that might explain the results and establish generative and model-comparison procedures to demonstrate the validity of their winning model and individual parameters.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The use of maximum likelihood versus hierarchical methods to fit models on an individual level may reduce some of the outliers and improve model identifiability.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "There was little discussion given the structure of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and the strategy of the game (that defection is always dominant), meaning that the preferences of the adolescents cannot necessarily be distinguished from the incentives of the game.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "A more detailed discussion of the incentives embedded in the Prisoner's Dilemma task would be valuable, particularly since the authors' interpretation of reduced adolescent cooperativeness might be reconsidered in light of the zero-sum nature of the game.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The modeling framework may not capture higher-order social inferences that distinguish learning from human partners versus non-human agents, such as trait-based beliefs about partners' moral dispositions.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The developmental interpretation would be strengthened by considering possible non-linear relationships between age and model parameters, such as fitting age as a continuous variable with quadratic or spline terms.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The two age groups compared - adolescents and adults - differ not only in age but also in sociocultural and economic backgrounds, which may systematically affect cooperative behavior and valuation of rewards.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The modeling approach is compelling in its ability to distinguish between learned expectations and the intrinsic value of cooperation.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The authors skillfully compare relevant models to demonstrate which mechanisms drive cooperation behavior in the two age groups.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The idea does not clearly account for how stable versus changing phases within each trial schedule shape learning, even though reward structure is a critical influence. Without this consideration, the conceptual framing of the idea remains incomplete.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The division of participants at the legal threshold of 18 years should be more explicitly justified, as the age distribution appears continuous rather than clearly split.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

{"statement": "Such a multimodal approach is still rare in the study of human brain plasticity and allows us to discern the nature of information processing in blind people's early visual cortex, as well as the time course of information processing in a situation of significant brain adaptability.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The major weakness of the study lies in the assumption that species correlations between their current distribution and environments found today are back-projected to the far past before the rise of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which would mean that species responses to environmental cues do not evolve which is clearly not true.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The second major drawback lies in the way the research plan estimates the migratory routes of particular birds - no matter how good the data eBird provides is, population-specific connections between wintering and breeding sites cannot be determined since some might overwinter in India, some populations in Africa and the teleconnections between breeding and wintering sites of particular species will never be known.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The set of 50 avian species that migrate across the QTP is unclear, with unknown selection criteria and variability in their migratory strategies likely to affect the direction of the effects.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The position of the breeding sites relative to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will affect the azimuths and resulting migratory flyways, but the study does not outline the boundaries of breeding sites NE of the Plateau, making it absolutely unclear which breeding populations it covers.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "There is no way one can assess the performance of the statistical exercises, including the performances of the random forest models, Bayesian multivariate regression models, and other proposed statistical approaches.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

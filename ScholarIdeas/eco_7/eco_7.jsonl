{"statement": "The research plan focuses on ground beetle biodiversity and does not examine crop productivity, therefore the claim that this study demonstrates biodiversity enhancement without compromising yield lacks supporting evidence and requires either yield results or stronger justification.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The experimental design uses data from four different strip cropping experiments with no real spatial replication, as all sites differ in many aspects including different crops, different areas between years, different combinations, strip cropping design (orientation and width), and sampling effort with beetle sample sizes differing more than 35-fold between sites.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan does not specify where ground beetles will be collected within strips of varying widths (3-6 meters) and monoculture plots, which is problematic since distance from plot edge has been shown to dramatically affect carabid assemblages and could easily outweigh the differences being measured.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The experimental design places pitfall traps in strip cropping systems in closer proximity to each other than in monoculture fields, creating potential spatial autocorrelation issues that are not addressed and would require a much bigger, spatially replicated design to properly account for.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The experimental design does not account for the strong dependence of carabid richness and density on crop type, which could bias results if the design is not balanced across different crops and crop combinations.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan lacks essential methodological details including specific trap locations, treatment of missing traps for analyses, number of samples per crop or crop combination, and the logic behind each field trial design.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The experimental design does not standardize for rapid phenological changes in carabid assemblages across the year, making it difficult to compare assemblages collected at different phenological points within and across years.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan does not account for surrounding landscape structure, which is known to affect carabid richness and density and could bias observed differences between treatments at the same locations.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The statistical analysis approach does not clarify whether estimated marginal means will be used in the Generalized Linear Mixed Models, which needs to be specified for proper analysis.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research plan does not establish clear mechanistic hypotheses about whether strip cropping behaves similarly to intercropping, which has proven biodiversity benefits, and whether those benefits translate to strip cropping systems.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The use of indicator species analysis may be questionable given that predominantly highly eurytopic species are expected, which are by definition uncritical of their habitat, and the research plan lacks mechanistic hypotheses for suspected differences in species preferences between strip cropping and monocultures.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research plan raises the question of whether strip cropping fields contain rare species but does not elaborate on expectations for rare species prevalence or provide justification based on previous intercropping research.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}

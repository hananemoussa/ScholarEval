{"statement": "The experimental models are relatively small in scale (124M and 352M parameters), and larger models might provide a stronger case for BERT's use in generation tasks.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The proposed path selection method cannot guarantee to find the optimal decoding path despite claims of identifying optimal paths, as it is a form of beam search over the mask-predict algorithm and beam search cannot guarantee optimal solutions.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "When BERT-like models predict one token in each decoding step, they require the same number of decoding steps as AR models but with much larger compute per step since they cannot reuse kv cache during inference, providing no efficiency advantage.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The claim that path selection* incorporates path selection into the training process is misleading, as neither the sampling methods to generate pairs nor the computation of probability actually considers the path selection method.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The research plan does not address potential issues with Mask-Predict methods, such as potential mode collapse with many iterations, and needs more ablation studies about the designs and clear pseudo-codes.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

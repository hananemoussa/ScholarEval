{"statement": "The primary strength of this research plan lies in its accessibility and practicality, as the proposed binary number-based liquid handling methodology allows any laboratory with standard equipment, such as multichannel pipettes and 96-well plates, to readily construct all possible combinations of microbial consortia from a given set of species.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "This methodology greatly enhances access to full factorial designs for microbial consortium research, which were previously limited to labs with advanced microfluidic technology or required painstaking manual assembly procedures.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The proposed methodology is tailored to construct communities where the abundance of each strain is identical in each combination, which means combinations with a different number of strains also differ in the total initial amount of microbial cells, and variations in the initial proportions of the same set of strains cannot be readily explored.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The efficiency of the binary number-based method for combinatorial assembly of microbes in synthetic communities and clarity of the experimental design presentation is a strength.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The methodology will likely be useful for other types of experiments that require exhaustive testing of all possible combinations of a given set of reagents beyond microbial ecology applications, such as drug-drug antagonism and synergy studies.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The planned R script that generates a detailed experimental protocol for building the desired combination from any number of reagents is a useful practical contribution.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}

{"statement": "Conceptually, there seems to be a missed opportunity in that it is not clear what the network learns to do when presented with the 10 different VPM input patterns during the plasticity simulation, as the research plan does not specify whether the learning resulted in anything functionally significant such as better pattern discrimination, timing anticipation, or similarity detection. This is important to understand if one wants to assess the significance of synaptic changes due to plasticity.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The authors should include an analysis of the generality and specificity as it is unclear how the results would vary with different network initializations, simulation times, or parameter choices.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "A major limitation lies in the lack of mechanistic insights into the observed phenomena, particularly on aspects that are typically impossible to assess in traditional simplified models like layer-specific and layer-to-layer pathways-specific plasticity changes.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

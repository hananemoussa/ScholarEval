{"statement": "The hypothesis of a strategic and conservative slowdown implicitly assumes a similar cost function, which cannot be guaranteed, tested, or verified, and a conservative strategy with a different cost function can also explain the data.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The main strength of the research plan is the presence of directional effects expected under the hypothesis of mass estimation error.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan lacks a clear demonstration of quantitative match between the model and the data - a directional effect is not sufficient because the model makes clear quantitative predictions about how this effect should vary across directions.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The two hypotheses (mass underestimation vs deliberate speed reduction) can only be distinguished in terms of velocity/acceleration patterns, which should display specific changes during movement execution with mass underestimation.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Since the taikonauts are tested after 2 or 3 weeks in flight, neuromuscular deconditioning could explain the general decrease in movement speed through a classical time-effort trade-off, providing an alternative interpretation that needs to be ruled out.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The planned movements in the experiment design are much faster (average duration approx. 350 ms) than similar self-paced movements studied in other works, and it's unclear if the same results would hold for slower self-paced movements.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research plan treats the arm as a second-order low-pass filter but it is not clear if and how the authors account for potential modification of the time constants of the system due to changes in muscle properties and damping in microgravity.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The experimental design using finger sliding on a touchscreen surface may introduce confounding effects, as in weightlessness the taikonauts would need to actively press downward to maintain contact while on Earth gravity does the work, potentially affecting friction forces in a direction-dependent fashion.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The experimental design neglects the potential instability of the base of the arm - while taikonauts use their left arm to stabilize their bodies, it is unclear to what extent this can reproduce the stability of being seated in a chair in Earth gravity.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

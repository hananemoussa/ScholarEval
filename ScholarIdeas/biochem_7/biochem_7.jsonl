{"statement": "The idea lacks a clear grounding in the rigor of prior research and itt does not sufficiently situate itself within existing work on P. putida chemotaxis and copper resistance, relying instead on broader discussions of bacterial chemotaxis. This weakens the foundation of the idea and makes its distinct contribution less clear.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The rationale for identifying CheA-binding proteins is vague, particularly given that CheA has been extensively studied and its functional domains (P1 to P5) have been well characterized.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "It is unclear whether P. putida CheA contains a unique motif or domain compared to its counterparts from other bacteria, and whether CsoR binds to other bacterial CheAs or only to P. putida CheA.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The chemotaxis experiment design is premature and needs to be confirmed by other approaches, such as the response index (RI) method used in reference 29 for bacterial response to phenol.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "There is no planned assessment of whether deletion of csoR or cheA has any impact on P. putida resistance to high concentrations of copper.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "It is not clear how the putative new interactions with CheA would be integrated into diverse responses to various chemoattractants/repellents.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "It is unclear how specific responses involving individual interacting partners would be possible with such a heterogeneous pool of putative CheA-complexes in a cell.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "It is not clear how Miller units can be accurately or precisely determined from the proposed solid plate BTH assay, as the reference cited describes a protocol for liquid culture.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

{"statement": "The recording electrodes cover regions in the primary and secondary cortices. It is well known that these two regions process sounds quite differently (for example, one has tonotopy, the other does not), and separating recordings from both regions is important to conclude anything about sound representations.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

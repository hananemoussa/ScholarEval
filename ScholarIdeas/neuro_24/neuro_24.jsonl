{"statement": "The use of whole-brain calcium imaging as a measure of brain activity may not fully capture the localized nature of seizure initiation and propagation, as seizures often begin in specific regions or even within specific populations of neurons within those regions, potentially limiting the understanding of galanin's role in epilepsy.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Galanin's effects may vary across different brain areas, likely influenced by the predominant receptor types expressed in those regions, which the whole-brain approach may not adequately address.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The use of PTZ as a 'stressor' is questionable since PTZ induces seizures rather than conventional stress in the experimental design.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "All of the various genetic manipulations (galanin overexpression, galanin knockout, and galr1a knockout) are non-conditional as performed, meaning that developmental impacts on the observed results have not been controlled for and may have had a confounding influence on the findings.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan does not include behavioral assessments of seizure or locomotor activity that would be expected given the characterizations of the eaat2a-/- model in previous work that showed these behavioral data for this zebrafish model.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The methodology currently lacks mechanistic insight in the role of galanin during seizure-like activity induced by PTZ, despite clear relationships between galanin and brain activity during interictal or seizure-free periods.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan relies very heavily on calcium imaging of different mutant lines, and additional methods could strengthen the data, translational relevance, and interpretation (e.g., acute pharmacology using galanin agonists or antagonists, brain or cell recordings, biochemistry, etc).", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "strength of the study lies primarily in its methodological approach using whole-brain Calcium imaging facilitated by the transparency of zebrafish larvae. Additionally, the use of transgenic zebrafish models is an advantage, as it enables genetic manipulations to investigate specific aspects of galanin signaling. This combination of advanced imaging and genetic tools allows for addressing galanin's role in regulating brain activity.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Use of a glutamatergic signaling-based genetic model of epilepsy (Eaat2a-/-) is likely the most appropriate selection to test how galanin signaling can alter seizure activity, as galanin is known to reduce glutamatergic release as an inhibitory mechanism in rodent hippocampal neurons via GalR1a (alongside GIRK activation effects).", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

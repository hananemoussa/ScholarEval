{"statement": "This research plan is very interesting to read and the possibility that female moths might use sound as an additional sensory modality during host-searching is exciting and very relevant to the field of insect-plant interactions.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "It did not become entirely clear why a click frequency of 60 clicks per minute was proposed for most experiments, while the plants only produce clicks at a range of 30 clicks per minute.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "Offering the choice between two single plants while providing the sound from a group of plants is not the most ecologically reasonable choice in the proposed experimental design.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The research plan should further explore the relevance of different frequencies and dB-levels in the experimental design.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The transferability of the findings towards insects and Lepidopterans in general is questionable since not all insects possess a tympanic organ and might therefore not be able to detect the plant clicks.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Generalist herbivores like Spodoptera might be more inclined to use these clicks than specialists, which very much rely on certain chemical cues to find their host plants, limiting the broader applicability of this study.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The study only investigates a single moth species (S. littoralis) and the results might therefore only hold true for this species and closely related species, but not necessarily for other moth species such as Sphingidae or even butterflies.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "This research plan presents an interesting and fresh approach as it investigates whether female moths utilize plant-emitted ultrasounds, particularly those associated with dehydration stress, in their egg-laying decision-making process.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The proposed experiments are very well designed.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "If female moths use the sounds emitted by dehydrated plants as cues to decide where to oviposit, the hypothesis would predict that they would avoid such sounds, creating a contradiction that needs careful consideration in interpreting the findings.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

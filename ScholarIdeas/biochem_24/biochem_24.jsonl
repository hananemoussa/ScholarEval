{"statement": "The study is significant because stem cells and many cancers exhibit metabolic rewiring of pyruvate metabolism, providing new insights into how the fate of pyruvate can be tuned to influence Drosophila biomass accrual, and how pyruvate pools can influence the balance between carbohydrate and protein biosynthesis.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan includes rigorous dissection of metabolic rewiring and use of Drosophila and mammalian cell systems to dissect carbohydrate:protein crosstalk.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "There are questions related to how this protein:carbohydrate crosstalk interfaces with lipid biosynthesis.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The combination of complementary approaches, ranging from Drosophila genetics to metabolic flux measurements in mammalian cells, strengthens the findings and shows a conservation of MPC effects across evolution.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The idea that MPC can override hormonal controls on gluconeogenesis and cell size may not be conceptually well-founded, since it relies on evidence from immortalized cell lines or primary hepatocytes, which do not fully capture mammalian physiology.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Measurements of NADH/NAD ratios in conditions where these are manipulated genetically and pharmacologically would strengthen the eventual findings of the research plan.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}

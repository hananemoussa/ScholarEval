{"statement": "The voltage imaging using Voltron2 in this study is a highly novel method that allows recording not only suprathreshold-level spikes but also subthreshold-level activity, with high frame rate offering time resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings and enabling visualization of actual cell locations for examining spatial properties.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "This is technically an impressive study, using an emerging approach that allows single-cell resolution voltage imaging in animals that, while head-fixed, can move through a real environment using the air-lifted plastic track system.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The idea makes strong population-level claims, but conceptually it is not well supported, as it rests on a sparse foundationâ€”very small neuronal samples derived from limited datasets and emerging, but not yet well-validated, technology. This raises doubts about whether the idea can substantiate broad conclusions.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The experiments are flawed in that the LFP recorded from the contralateral side of the hippocampus is not truly \"local\" to the CA1 pyramidal cells being imaged, given that both theta and ripple signals exhibit profound differences as a function of location including phase changes along proximo-distal and dorso-ventral axes and depth-dependent reversals for theta, while ripples are often local phenomena occurring independently within fractions of millimeters.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

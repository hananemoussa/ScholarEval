{"statement": "The plam aim to add to our knowledge about quinofumelin, a novel quinoline fungicide, but previous reports by Higashimura et al., 2022 had already identified DHODH as the target for quinofumelin, making this knowledge not new.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The idea seems to overstate its novelty in explaining the mechanism of action of quinofumelin, without fully grounding itself in prior work. The framing risks overlooking earlier contributions and would benefit from acknowledging prior research more centrally, rather than treating it as a secondary point.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "Some experiments lack controls which would make the interpretation of results difficult/not accurate.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The comparison between quinofumelin-treated deletion strains in the presence of different metabolites may not suggest the fungicide is FgDHODHII specific, and a wild type is required in this experiment.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The proposed model makes use of both the protein and drug sequence to predict novel drug-target interactions, with the model only requiring SMILES representation of drugs and protein sequences, which are highly-available features across many DTI datasets.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The proposed mechanisms integrating measure theory, information geometry, and optimal transport are interesting and add over the current existing state-of-the-art.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "major"}

{"statement": "The proposed datasets (Human, C. elegans, Davis, and GPCR) have already reached near-saturation performance levels and are relatively small in size, and larger, more challenging datasets such as PDBbind, BindingDB, and KIBA should be considered.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

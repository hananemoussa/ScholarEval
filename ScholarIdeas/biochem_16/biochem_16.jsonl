{"statement": "A major conceptual concern is that the proposed mechanism—alterations in circulating and bone factors leading to impaired bone quality—seems inconsistent with preserved bone mass in T2DM, making it unclear how the idea explains impaired quality without loss of mass.", "type": "weakness", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}

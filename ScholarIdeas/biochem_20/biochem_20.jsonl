{"statement": "The research plan utilizes a newly developed technique for growing T. gondii cystic parasites in a human muscle-cell myotube format, which enables culturing and analysis of cysts for screening anti-parasitic compounds.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The proposed approach enables screening of compound libraries to identify those that inhibit growth in both vegetative (tachyzoite) forms and bradyzoites (cysts), providing convincing proof-of-principle evidence for the myotube-based in vitro culture system.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "major"}
{"statement": "The research plan utilizes metabolomic approaches to characterize metabolic 'signatures' that provide clues to the potential targets of candidate inhibitors, although falls short of identifying the actual targets.", "type": "strength", "axis": "soundness", "severity": "minor"}
{"statement": "The work utilizes a bradyzoites culture technique that was published recently by the same group, with the further metabolic characterization providing indirect target validation and highlighting different metabolic outcomes for different inhibitors.", "type": "strength", "axis": "contribution", "severity": "minor"}
